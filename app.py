Over time, the affected leaves start turning yellow. Gradually, the leaves become dry and may start curling up from the edges, which hampers the photosynthesis process and weakens the plant.",

Use 40 kg of nitrogen, 20 kg of phosphorus, and 20 kg of potassium per hectare. The nitrogen boosts leaf growth, phosphorus helps in root and stem development, and potassium strengthens the plantâ€™s defenses against diseases. Additionally, incorporating Azotobacter biofertilizer at a rate of 1 kg per acre enhances nitrogen fixation in the soil, which can naturally improve plant health and vigor."
