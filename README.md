# üåæ CropCare

CropCare is an AI-driven solution designed to help farmers monitor crop health, predict potential disease outbreaks, and receive actionable insights. By analyzing crop images and environmental data, CropCare empowers farmers to take preventive measures and make informed decisions to improve yield and reduce crop losses.

## üöÄ Project Overview
CropCare leverages machine learning and real-time data analysis to identify crop diseases and suggest preventive measures. The platform offers a web and mobile interface for users, allowing easy access to crop health monitoring and disease prediction.

### Key Features
- **Disease Detection**: Analyze crop images to identify diseases.
- **Environmental Data Analysis**: Use real-time environmental data to support crop health predictions.
- **Actionable Insights**: Provide farmers with specific advice to mitigate disease risks and improve crop yield.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use web and mobile applications for farmers.
- **Fertilizer Recommendation**: Suggest optimal fertilizer application based on crop and disease type.
